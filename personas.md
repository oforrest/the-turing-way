# Personas & Pathways

Personas are character sketches of fictional contributors and users who might do something with the Turing Way.
Following the [Mozilla Open Leadership training](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/bring-on-contributors-using-personas-and-pathways/), we created personas for contributors to the Turing Way based on participants in past trainings and events, and have created personas for users based on our target audiences.
This will help us in our development of the Turing Way community such as through the Readme and Contributing Guidelines.

We have also imagined how our personas might interact with our project – the "pathway" they take to get involved and to sustain involvement which comprises a few key phases:

1. Discovery - How they first hear about the project or group.
2. First Contact - How they first engage with the project or group, their initial interaction.
3. Participation - How they first participate or contribute.
4. Sustained Participation - How their contribution or involvement can continue.
5. Networked Participation - How they may network within the community.
6. Leadership - How they may take on some additional responsibility on the project, or begin to lead.

Below you’ll find a range of personas and pathways, showing how their interactions with the Turing Way can improve and enrich the project.
Each example is meant to suggest ways you might interact with, learn from, and contribute to the Turing Way so hopefully one resonates with you and empowers you to get involved!

If you do not relate to any of the personas described and are struggling to figure out how to get involved or use this resource, please open an issue or get in contact on our Gitter channel letting us know what the barriers are!

## Contributor personas

### Sam, a PhD student with no GitHub experience

Sam is a PhD student in biology at University College London.
They are learning how to code in Python, but have not yet had any training in version control or GitHub.
They're really interested in learning how to use open notebooks such as Jupyter to do their analysis, so that they can easily share their work for critique with their very busy supervisor.

1. **Discovery** - Sam hears about the Turing Way Book Dash events through an email from the department's Open Science Champion.
2. **First Contact** - Sam checks out the GitHub repository to learn more about the project and see what skills are needed that they may be able to contribute.
3. **Participation** - Sam attends the London Book Dash, accepted for their enthusiasm to learn how to make his PhD research reproducible. They participate in the discussions, read existing chapters and scroll through issues to see where they can contribute.
4. **Sustained Participation** - After gaining experience with GitHub through submitting pull requests and issues during the Book Dash, Sam is empowered to continue contributing to the online discussion and suggesting topics for the book, as well as editing and reviewing existing chapters which they apply to their own research.
5. **Networked Participation** - Sam encourages some of his fellow PhD students to read the Turing Way and start using GitHub.
6. **Leadership** - Sam submits one of their research projects as a case study for the Turing Way.



###  Alex, a researcher with Git/GitHub experience and book topic expertise

Alex is a postdoc in Manchester who programs in R.
They are passionate about open data and using data for good, but also understand it can be more complex than that.
They attend data science meetups in the city, but are interested in finding a community working towards improving how research is conducted.
They have experience with GitHub and contributing to open projects.

1. **Discovery** - Alex first hears about the Turing Way via Twitter ([#TuringWay](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TuringWay&src=typed_query)).
2. **First Contact** - They land on the project's README and look for the contributing guidelines to see where their skills can be applied.
3. **Participation** - They find an issue asking for help on writing the Credit for Reproducible Research chapter and add a few paragraphs on how to properly cite research software.
4. **Sustained Participation** - After constructive feedback and collaborating with the Turing Way team, Alex follows the community on social media and applies to attend the Manchester Book Dash.
5. **Networked Participation** - They invite other friends and colleagues from the Rstats community, who have expertise on some of the book topics, to get involved.
6. **Leadership** - Alex volunteers to write the chapter on Scoping a data project - RSEs that they found requested in the [Book Skeleton](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/book_skeleton.md).
